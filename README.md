# GoTiny: A Link Shortener App

GoTiny is a web application that allows you to create short and catchy versions of long URLs, which will redirect to the original URLs when clicked. 
You can also specify how long or how many times the GoTiny links will be valid before they are removed. 
You can track the number of visits for each GoTiny link and see how popular they are.

GoTiny is useful for sharing links that are too long or complicated to type or remember, such as articles, videos, documents, etc. 
You can also use it to measure the engagement of your audience and optimize your marketing campaigns.
